# Color Customization Guide

## 🎨 For Media Team - Easy Color Customization

Your media team can now customize all website colors without any technical knowledge!

## How to Access

1. Go to: `http://your-website.com/admin/colors`
2. Or if running locally: `http://localhost:3001/admin/colors`

## How to Use

### Basic Steps:
1. **Open Two Tabs**: 
   - Tab 1: Open the color editor at `/admin/colors`
   - Tab 2: Open the main website (any page)
2. **Browse Colors**: Scroll through all available colors organized by category
3. **Filter by Category**: Click on category buttons at the top to see only specific sections (Navigation, Events Page, etc.)
4. **Change a Color**: 
   - Click on the color square to open the color picker
   - OR type a hex color code directly (e.g., `#FF0000` for red)
5. **See Changes Instantly**: Changes apply immediately in BOTH tabs - you'll see the updates in real-time on the main website tab!
6. **Save Your Work**: Click "Save Colors" to save your changes permanently (though changes are already saved automatically)
7. **Reset if Needed**: Click "Reset to Default" to restore all original colors

### Advanced Features:

- **Export Colors**: Click "Export Colors" to download your color scheme as a JSON file (great for backup!)
- **Import Colors**: Click "Import Colors" to load a previously exported color scheme

## Color Categories

Colors are organized into these categories:

- **Global**: Background, text, and card colors used throughout the site
- **Navigation**: Header/navigation bar colors
- **Social Icons**: Individual social media icon colors
- **About Page**: Executive team card colors
- **Podcast Page**: All podcast-related colors
- **Events Page**: Event page colors
- **Learn Page**: Learning resources page colors
- **Resources Page**: Resources page colors
- **Notable Figures Page**: Notable figures page colors
- **Get Involved Page**: Get involved page colors

## Tips

1. **Start Small**: Try changing one category at a time to see the effects
2. **Save Often**: Remember to click "Save Colors" after making changes
3. **Export for Backup**: Export your color scheme before making major changes
4. **Test Different Pages**: After changing colors, visit different pages to see how they look
5. **Contrast Matters**: Make sure text colors have good contrast with background colors for readability

## Troubleshooting

- **Changes not saving?**: Make sure you clicked "Save Colors" button
- **Want to undo?**: Click "Reset to Default" to restore all original colors
- **Page looks broken?**: Reset to default and try again
- **Can't see color picker?**: Make sure your browser supports HTML5 color inputs (modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge all support this)

## Notes

- Colors are saved in your browser's local storage
- If you clear your browser data, your custom colors will be lost (unless you exported them)
- Changes only affect your view - they don't change the source code
- For permanent changes that affect all users, contact the development team
